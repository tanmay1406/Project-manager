Project=>
1 PRD project requierment document 
used to keep what to build and what not to build 
for example we want a authentication feature 
we need a create acc, login , google login, forgot password
PMP project management platform 




the very first step after creating the PRD is to set up the project 


to setup node for backed use command=> npm init 
and then fill up the rest of the list and thhen edit the script in the JSON file to your requierment



Now we need to make a feature such that all the devs are in sync in writing the code 
to get the uniformat we use prettier , write the command =>  npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

and then use => npx prettier . --write 


now you may ask where are the uniform syntax =>many of them are already set as default 
and for others we need to create a file for it .prettierrc
and .prettierignore this tells it what files not to touch 



# Auto restart your server
kuch bhi change karein toh server apne app refresh ho jaye uske liye kya karein?
nodemon will be used 
node --watch

use the command => npm install --save-dev nodemon
this refreshes the server everytime it detects a change in any of the files 

and then change the  JSON file from node to nodemon


# .env files on backend
use the command=>npm i d0tenv 
this is to safe guard the sensitive data that is excessed through process.env
